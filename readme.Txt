   Having skipped many of the American Football brackets that have been run in the office, I was inspired by ESPN and am trying to start a real football bracket in the office for the world cup.  I am thinking of doing it in two parts. 
 
    $15 dollar buy in - The first part is guessing who moves on from group play. 1 point for guessing who moves one 1 point for guessing if they would be in first or second. At the end of group play tally up everyone’s points and the winner gets the pot (multiple people will split it).
 
    $15 dollar buy in -    The second pool will be the traditional bracket pool, winner takes all. Guessing who wins the cup nets you the pot, in case of a tie, guessing who comes in second, then third then 4th will be the tie breaker. If there is a tie pot gets split. In the unlikely event that  no one guesses any of the top 4, we will award a point for each team guessed down the bracket. People with the highest point splits the pot. To be purely objective  guessing the teams in the following places awards you the following points:
    1st – 60
   2nd – 30
   3rd  - 15
   4th – 10
  5th+ - 1
 
Fill in the attached visio and drop off at my desk with your name and the money if you are interested, by June 12th. If you only want one of the pools let me know which you are entering. Also please forward this to anyone you know who I did not include. I just took a guess at who might be interested in the pool.
